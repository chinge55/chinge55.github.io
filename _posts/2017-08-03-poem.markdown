Walking on the deserted street,<br>
I'm tired and the sun is about to fade<br>
I need to stop and call it for the day<br>
In the distance,<br>
I see a small house, a hovel<br>
I reach to its tiny door just about to open<br>
Will they have enough?<br>
For another empty stomach<br>
Again,<br>
I walk on the same street<br>
In the distance,<br>
I see a big house, a manor<br>
I reach to its huge gateway, just about to open<br>
Will I be good enough?<br>
For those fat cats, eating with the knives<br>
Again, I walk on the same street<br>
After long hours, can't continue so I turn back<br>
Sun is about to rise<br>
Neither did I stop, nor can I walk<br>
