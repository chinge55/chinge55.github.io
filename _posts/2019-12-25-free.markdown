Tall I stand on my joyous days<br>
Cannot be hurt, never to die<br>
Boon of immortality<br>
Passed by the lord<br>

Oh these joyous days<br>
I roam wherever, whenever<br>
Riches and fame I’ve got it all<br>
Ladies, Oh! Don’t even mention it<br>

Oh these boring days<br>
I’ve seen it all, I’ve done it all<br>
Drove the fastest car, scaled the highest peak<br>
Nothing seems to excite me<br>
Nothing lights a spark<br>

Oh these days of agony<br>
Buried my wife and my child<br>
They went with a smile and left me crying<br>

Oh lord please kill me<br>
Stabbing, hanging drowning and what not<br>
Jailed here forever<br>
In this curse of immortality<br>
Waiting to be free.. To die!<br>
