I"ý<p>In my study of Deep Learning, there have been a lot of times that Iâ€™ve created something cool but had no way to show it to anyone. I found it the hard way that not many people believe in a complex system like Speech Recognition looking at the loss graph and output of some test data.</p>

<p>The problems I faced:
I built a great AI model, finetuning it for weeks. I tried to show it to other people but I had to.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load google colab</li>
  <li>Connect it to google drive</li>
  <li>Copy and load the model</li>
  <li>Waitâ€¦
That is enough to kill a manâ€™s enthusiasm .</li>
</ul>

<p>I copy the colab code into a server, build a flask API around it and try to run it. It now shows the kind of tensorflow errors that Iâ€™d never seen before. Running tensorflow graphs and trying to build an API around it in the same program doesnâ€™t work that easily.</p>

<p>Upon further research I found about tensorflow serving.  It serves the Deep Learning model as a REST server. 
And It works pretty well.</p>
