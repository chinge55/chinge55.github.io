I"Ù<p>Pokhara is the city I have lived in almost all my life. I was born here, studied here and if everything goes fine; I am thinking of settling down here. It is truly a beautiful city. They call it the city of seven lakes but Iâ€™d say there are only three. The fourth largest one is more like a pond; Iâ€™ve not visited the others but it could be that I never noticed them. Thereâ€™s a long list of places to visit; the lakes, the Seti riverside, Davis falls etc etc.</p>
