Hi, I'm Sangam Khanal. I'm a computer engineering student. I love computers and hope to do cool things in it.
I love to work in Artificial Intelligence. The thing that pulls me towards it is probably the fact that the end product kinda looks like magic.

Writing equations in this website have been a huge pain for me. So if you have some elegant solution, please send me a message.

*Thank You for reading!*
